# [Skills for Hire Project: Halifax Canoe & Kayak](https://amandapennell.github.io/hfx_canoe/)

## Part 1: Responsive Frontend
### The Brief
Our client, Halifax Canoe and Kayak, would like a new website. Obviously, they want it to work across a myriad of devices. They would also like the ability to post information about upcoming adventures and allow visitors to register for trips.

It is your job to design and build them a fully functional website.

Our client would like a ‘responsive’ example of the home page.

Our client is requesting the following as ‘must haves’:
- When the hamburger menu is clicked, the menu must ‘toggle’ in and out
- The main content (including the image) must get no wider than 1000px
- Below 1000px, the main content must be 100% across the screen
- Filler content (Any text will do)

### General Directions
The project must include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You must, at a minimum, use the assets our client has supplied.
Feel free to go beyond the minimum!

### Supplied Assets
- [The main image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulinov/skillsProjects/main/canoe.jpg) 
- [Hamburger icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulinov/skillsProjects/main/hamburger.png)
- [Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulinov/skillsProjects/main/paddle-white.png) 

(Use these as local or external images in your code)

## Part 2: Form
### Form
To test the usability of the new site, our client would like to see the Book A Trip form.
The form must use the GET method, and have the following input fields:
- Email (as text – no validation needed)
- Location (as select with 2 options)
- Trip Date (as date)

Next: 
- Create book.php and thankyou.php
- book.php will have the form
- thankyou.php will GET the data entered in the form and display it back in a sentence or two
